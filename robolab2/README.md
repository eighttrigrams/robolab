# Robolab | Robolab 2

Robolab port to support modern opengl.

## Start

To start take the env from opengl-playground

```
. ../opengl-playground/python/env/bin/activate
```

# Historical Info

I needed a modern opengl playground for python from which to start 

So I took 

https://github.com/danielmarreirosdeoliveira/moderngl_playground.git

and forked it to

https://github.com/danielmarreirosdeoliveira/moderngl_playground.git

Then I stripped it down to a hello world example with PyQt5
